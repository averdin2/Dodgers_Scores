### Project Notes

Due to the API I was using, I could not find a way to dynamically generate game data links for a specific game so the app does not work as originally intended. I did learn a lot from this project though. I learned a lot about using React and Redux together as well as using the Fetch API to gather data. The project does work correctly if a proper game day API link is provided in the search field. Bellow are a few links to past games that will show the app working as intended.

If a link for an in-progress game is provided, the ‘Refresh Scores’ button will update the scores for that in-progress game. The first link is already inputted when the app is opened.

Here are a few links you can try:
