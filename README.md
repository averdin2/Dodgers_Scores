## Dodgers Scoreboard App

A simple React web application that gives gameday information for Los Angeles Dodgers Games
Still a work in progress.
For more project information check the projects document folder.

Note: There is no way, at this moment, in this project to change the specific game without hard coding the game id.
The scores do not update live or real time. The page needs to be reloded manually to reflect any game updates.
