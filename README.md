### Project Notes

Due to the API I was using, I could not find a way to dynamically generate game data links for a specific game. This effectively makes the project useless for most users. However, my project still does work if the right link is provided. Bellow are sample links of past games. You can see that by entering these links into the form field and pressing the ”Refresh Scores” button, the scores will display for the finished game. If a link for an in-progress game is provided, the ‘Refresh Scores” button will update the scores for that in-progress game.

Here are a few links you can try:
