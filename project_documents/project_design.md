# Project Design

## Introduction
This project is designed using a mobile first approach. The overall design of the project is very simple as there is only one page for users to navigate through and there is very little user input required for the functionality of the project. The color scheme of the project is minimal to correspond with the minimal nature of the project. The following section will explain the design in more detail.
